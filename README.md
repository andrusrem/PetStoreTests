# PetStoreTests

This assignment is a part of an actual take-home task for a QA Engineer position within a company, so this is what you can expect to do when applying for QA roles. 

## Test endpoints
For testing were taken next called endpoints:

POST /pet
PUT /pet
GET /pet/{petId}
GET /pet/{getByStatus}
DELETE /pet/{petId}

## Testing procces
Some of test not run as was planned, how I understand due to issues in Api itself.
